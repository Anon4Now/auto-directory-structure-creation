# Pen-testing Directory Structure

This code is designed to create a file structure that can be used to organize data aquired during a pen-test of a target. I made this because I wanted to stay organized, and I found myself irritated by the constant manual necessity of creating these directory structure for every target. **START-NOTE** I will be looking to make this code read from likely a YAML/TOML file to create whatever directory structure the user wants. Right now it is hard-coded to be what is represented below. **END-NOTE**

## Tool Functionality:

- Generates a directory structure that can be used to keep track of information
- Will allow for the '-h or -help' flag to be provided for more information
- This tool has three optional arguments:
  - '-name OR --name' name the starting directory (e.g., targets name) | if no arg passed, the starting directory will be named 'defaultProject'
  - '-path OR --path' name the path for where to create the directory structure (e.g., /home/projects) | if no arg is passed, the current directory will be used
  - '-branch OR --branch' choose whether to create just one of the second-level branches (i.e., IPT, EPT) | if no arg is passed, both will be created

## Tool Requirements:

- To use the default functionality of this tool, no additional libraries or modules are needed
- This code does either need to be pulled down and compiled with GO compiler, or the binary can be taken from the GitHub repo

## Quick Notes:

- This was designed in its current state to work with a Linux OS. However if desired it can be altered to fit a Windows OS.
